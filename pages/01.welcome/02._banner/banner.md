My name is Pedro, I am Spanish and I discovered Grav CMS back in 2020. I like to learn and play with CMS to create simple websites. When I discovered Grav, I thought it could be a good system for building simple websites. Over time I discovered its potential and decided to actively help the Grav community.

So I decided to start creating themes for Grav and collaborate on other projects, like Gantry, another powerful web design framework. I hope that my themes help more and more people to approach Grav CMS and try all its benefits.
